	<h2> A tiny bit more </h2>
		<p> I am a sophomore and I am majoring in computing in the arts: digital media. </p>
			<p> When i have free time me and my friends usually walk around Charleston, play some games, or watch some Netflix in the room. </p>
			<p> I don't consider myself the most interesting person so my lists are pretty small. This summer I did go to the beach with friends and other funs things though. Currently I live in berry dorm next to a few friends I met freshman year. </p>
